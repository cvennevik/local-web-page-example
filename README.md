# Local web page example

This is a demonstration of how you can browse web pages on your local file system, as easily as if you hosted them on a web server.

## How to use

- Clone the repository to your local file system
- Open index.html in your web browser of choice

That's it.

I've tested this on my Windows machine, using Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.

If this doesn't work in a specific browser or on a specific operating system, I'd appreciate if you sent me a message about it, so I can know in what contexts this doesn't work.

## Why does this matter?

Assuming you know how to do web development:

You know how you can develop and host web pages and static web apps online? And how those are useful to people?

With minimal setup, you can "host" those exact same things - anything you think can think of - on your local computer. You can even bookmark them, or make them your homepage! You can develop your own little personal web browser utilities, just for you.

I wasn't aware of this myself, so I made this to share with others who also are not aware and who also would get excited about the idea.
